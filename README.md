# Howdy!
* I'm currently working at [Angaza](https://www.angaza.com/) to alleviate poverty by expanding access to clean energy products and the internet.
* I enjoy using technology to create (hopefully something valuable), to solve problems, and to understand how the world works. However, I think that technology isn't the (sole) answer to everything.
* Please reach out, I'd love to connect!
